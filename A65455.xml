            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE read that <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> who was King of <hi>Salem,</hi> King of Peace, was alſo King of Righteouſneſs. And the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> tells us, that <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Peace have kiſſed each other,</hi> Pſal. 85. 10. And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 32. 17, 18. tells us, <hi>That the work of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace, and the effect of righteouſneſs, quietneſs:</hi> the Apoſtle joyns Peace and Holineſs together, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. Thus we ſee that Peace and Righteouſneſs, and Peace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, are like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his <hi>Gemelli,</hi> and like <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bekah's</hi> Twins, that went together; they are a moſt lovely pair, which we meet in Scripture hand in hand together, like two Turtle-doves that feed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſleep together; and indeed theſe things, which (in Scripture) God hath ſo joyned together, men muſt not put aſunder; but are to be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the Root and Branch, and the Fountain and Stream which always go together; and as the two Tables of the Law, which ought not to be ſevered.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51850:3"/>
            <p>Men muſt not think to ſit quietly under their own Vines and Figg-trees, if they diſquiet God by their Sins; nor muſt they think to have inward-peace, ſo long as they work Abominations. Have you ſeen the Shadow following the Subſtance? As naturally doth Anxiety and Trouble follow Sin. The rouling of the Seas and the blowing of the Winds is not more natural, than for Sin to be accompanied with trouble and horrour, Sin being the true mortal-cauſe thereof. In Heaven there is no fear nor trouble, becauſe in Heaven there is no Sin. Our firſt Parents converſed with God in Paradiſe very confidently; they never grew timerous till they grew ſinful; ſo ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> Sinned, he preſently became acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with horrour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zophar</hi> ſpeaking of a wicked man, <hi>Job</hi> 20. 20, 22, 24. ſaith thus: <hi>Surely he ſhall not feel quietneſs; the bow of ſteel ſhall ſtrike him thorough, terrours are upon him:</hi> A wicked man being without God, and without Chriſt, is like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove without the Ark, in a reſtleſs condition. <hi>Tribulation and anguiſh to every ſoul that ſinneth,</hi> Rom. 2. 9. What peace, ſo long as thy Mother <hi>Jeſabels</hi> Whoredoms and Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts are many in number? <hi>From whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?</hi> James 4. 1. What the <hi>Comoedian</hi> ſaid of a perſon, may be truely ſaid of Sin, <hi>Davus hic perturbat omnia.</hi> It is Sin that maketh all our diſturbances.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:51850:3"/>
            <p>Holineſs freeth men from torment, either by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the cauſe of it, or directing to the cure: It removes the chief grounds of trouble and diſquiet, and it miniſters all the true cauſes of Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of mind. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>: Purity poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth men with an aſſurance of the beſt things, but Sin makes the condition of men to be full of trouble and unquietneſs: Sin hath been the occaſion of Wars between Kingdoms and Nations, ſo that thouſands have been ſlain, Cities, Towns, and Kingdoms have been made heaps of Rubbiſh and diſſolate Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, full of Briers and Thorns, and habitations for wild Beaſts, Dragons, and Owls, and other doleful Creatures. Sin hath been an occaſion of much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs in the Spirits of men: there are many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and examples of this in Scripture, and in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory; I will give you as it were an handful out of a full Sack.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cain</hi> when he had ſlain his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> was a Fugitive and a Vagabond, affraid that whoſoever ſhould meet him ſhould ſlay him; crying out, <hi>That his puniſhment was greater than he could bear,</hi> Gen. 4. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, ſo that the joynts of his loyns were looſed, and his knees ſmote one against another,</hi> Dan. 5. In the New Teſtament, we find <hi>Herod</hi> perplexed after the murdering of <hi>John, Luke</hi> 9. we find <hi>Judas</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his betraying Chriſt, ſo fill'd with diſpair, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51850:4"/> he hang'd himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 4, 5. We find the unworthy gueſt ſpeechleſs; and <hi>Felix</hi> trembling when <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoned of Righteouſneſs, Temperance, and Judgment to come, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 25. We find (in Hiſtory) <hi>Cajaphas</hi> the High Prieſt, who gathered the Councel againſt Chriſt, and ſuborn'd falſe Witneſſes againſt him, was ſo perplexed that he killed himſelf. <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> who condemned our Saviour, ſoon after fell into diſgrace with the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour <hi>Caligula,</hi> and was ſent for by him to <hi>Rome,</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to ſome Accuſations made againſt him; but by the way he fell into ſuch terrours of Conſcience, as that he hang'd himſelf. <hi>Nero</hi> that monſter of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, who moſt unnaturally murdered his Mother <hi>Agripina,</hi> and his Wives, and his Tutours <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Lucan,</hi> and fired the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> and then charg'd it upon the Chriſtians (that ſo they might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the fury of the people) had at length ſuch an Hell in his Conſcience, as that he could reſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day nor night. <hi>Otho</hi> that murdered <hi>Galba, Cajus Marius</hi> that bloody Tyrant in <hi>Rome, Tiberius</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Pauſanias</hi> the <hi>Lacedoemonian</hi> King, And <hi>Richard</hi> the Third (here in <hi>England;)</hi> theſe were all of them troubled with fearful Dreams, and all of them felt the terrours and the laſhes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſo violent, that they could take no reſt.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>Would you know the occaſions of this? Why, they are four.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The Law is an occaſion of this:</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of the Law upon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> was in a dreadful manner, with ſigns of Terrour and the effects of Terrour; the Mount on which it was given burnt with fire, with darkneſs, clouds, and thick darkneſs, <hi>Duet.</hi> 4. a tempeſt, and the ſound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; ſo terrible was the ſight and voice, that <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf (a man eminent in Grace) did exceedingly fear and quake. From the time of <hi>Adam</hi> unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Law of Nature was almoſt obliterated; and when God ſet out the lively Image, the draught and abſtract of it by <hi>Moſes;</hi> it was in that dreadful manner, that it flaſhed wrath upon the fallen Creature, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoſe that heard it with a Spirit of fear, terrour, and trembling; the Law given upon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> gendered unto Bondage, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 24. it was a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of death and condemnation, it was a cuting and a killing letter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 9. I have ſlain them by the mouths of my Prophets: they that eſcaped the ſword of <hi>Hazel</hi> and <hi>Jehu,</hi> were to be ſlain by the ſword of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19. 17. The word of God is compared to a two edged-Sword; the Goſpel hath one Edge to ſlay Sin in

               </gap>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:51850:6"/> the Believer; and the Law hath another Edge to ſlay the Impenitent Sinner. <hi>I have hewed them by the prophets,</hi> Hoſ. 6. 5. It is like that Sword, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 24. that turned every way to keep <hi>Adam</hi> out of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> ſo doth the Law in the Conſcience of a Sinner, forbidding him (during his Agony) to enter into the Paradiſe of comfortable thoughts.</p>
            <p>The Law purely conſidered, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect had to the Covenant of Grace, was given to diſcover Sin, to proclaim Wrath and Curſes to the Sinner. The Law ſo conſidered, perſwades a Sinner that all thoſe Armies of Plagues, and Curſes, and Sorrows, and Sufferings denounced therein, ſhall with an unreſiſtable violence take hold on him, and purſue him with that fury as that he ſhall never be able to abide nor avoid it. The Law (alſo) being given upon <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> the <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi> Land (who deſcended from <hi>Hagar)</hi> out of the bounds of the Land of Promiſe (conſidered purely and abſtractively from the Covenant of Grace, and not as given in ſubordination and ſubſervenice to the Covenant of Grace) is to diſcover Sin, and the wrath of God againſt Sin; and this works terrour in the Sinner.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Sin is an occaſion of this:</hi> Guilt is an adjunct of Sin. <hi>All the world is guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 3. 19. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, liable to condemnation. Now this guilt works horrour; and upon this horrour
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51850:6"/> ſometimes follows deſparation. <hi>Peracto ſcelere mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudo ejus conſpiritur,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaid of <hi>Nero.</hi> When a man hath committed a ſin, then he ſeeth the greatneſs of it; that thereby the Law of God is violated; that thereby the Juſtice of God is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; and then he is ready to look upon himſelf as being excluded from thoſe Goſpel-priviledges, Adoption, Acceptation, Pardon, Peace, Spiritual Life, Liberty, Grace, and Glory in Jeſus Chriſt; then he looks upon himſelf as a Debtor to God, bound over to the penalty of his Law which he hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and then he is ready to accuſe and condemn himſelf, and is over-whelm'd with deſperation, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to deſtroy himſelf.</p>
            <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour being a Sinner (onely by imputation) met with conflicts and deſertions, and was in an Agony. Sin deprives men of God's favour, which is the ſpring of comfort: it keeps men from an intereſt in Chriſt, who is the Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Sin blinds the minde, it hardens the heart, it deads the affections, it alienates men from God, it works deluſions, deſperate thoughts, horrour of heart, and confuſion of ſpirit: Sin fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows men like an Avenger of Blood; Sin is a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſweet, like <hi>Eſaus</hi> Meſs, like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Quails, like <hi>Adonjah</hi>'s Dainties; when the Meal is ended, then comes the Reckoning. When Sin is unmaskt then that which before appeared ſweet and beautiful,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51850:7"/> will appear bitter and ugly; that which before was delightful, will then appear dreadful. Oh, the ſhame, the pain, the gall, the bitterneſs, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and hell that a true ſight of Sin will raiſe in the Soul! When the Dreſs is taken off, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more vile, and filthy, and terrible than Hell it ſelf. This made <hi>Anſelme</hi> ſay, <hi>That if he ſhould ſee the ſhame of Sin on the one hand, and the pains of Hell on the other, and must of neceſſity chooſe one, he would rather be thrust into Hell without Sin, than go into Heaven with Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Satan is an occaſion of trouble in wicked men:</hi> Thoſe Serpents that ſtung the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> were called fiery Serpents; poſſibly in regard of their colour, or rather in regard of their effect. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents biting the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did occaſion a burning in their fleſh, which made a fiery heat in thoſe whom they ſtung; ſo the old Serpent (the Devil) doth ſet the Souls of wicked men on fire, ſo that they think themſelves to be burning already, and expect to burn for ever (hereafter) in Hell.</p>
            <p>The Devil is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, an Adverſary; he is (alſo) called <hi>a roaring Lion,</hi> Pet. 1. 5, 8. as an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary he will ſpight men, and as a roaring Lion he will affright men. The Devil is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>an Accuſer,</hi> Rev. 12. 10. the Devil doth not onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe God to man, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5. and man to God, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 9, 10. but man to himſelf. Satan entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51850:7"/> 
               <hi>Judas, Luke</hi> 22. 3. to accuſe and torment him with thoughts of his Blood-guiltineſs: he is alſo called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from a compounded Verb that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to ſtrike through. We read of the Fiery-darts of the Devil; theſe Darts he ſhoots through the Spirits of wicked men, and doth infect, poiſon, and burn: He is called the Envious man, Satan from his craftineſs, <hi>Belial</hi> for his miſchievous wickedneſs, <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6, 15. <hi>Abaddon</hi> and <hi>Appollyon, Rev.</hi> 9. 11. as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deſtroyer, <hi>Belzebub</hi> (which ſignifies a Prince of flies) becauſe he doth vex and fret a Wounded Conſcience, (even) as flies do vex and fret a gaul'd Creature.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Conſcience is an occaſion of this:</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies Conſcience is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, it is derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which ſignifies to ſee or know, and the propoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies with, the Latine word, <hi>Conſcientia, is, quaſi cordis Scientia:</hi> So that the Greek, the Latine, and the Engliſh word Conſcience, (which is derived from the Latine) ſignifies a Knowledge with, that is, with ſome other thing, even as of the Heart. <hi>What man knows the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man, which is in him?</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 11. <hi>Thou knowest all the wickedneſs which thine heart is privy to, which thou didst to David my father: Solomon,</hi> there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the Conſcience of <hi>Shimei,</hi> 1 Kings 2. 44. And indeed Conſcience is the private Regiſter of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51850:8"/> mens Actions, it is a faithful Monitor within their breaſts, it is the Eye of the Soul, to over-ſee the whole Occaſions and Actions of the Heart and Life, it is the Tongue of wicked mens Souls, that makes report of the aberrations of their ways: <hi>The office of conſcience is to bear witneſs,</hi> Rom. 2. 15. and indeed it is a faithful witneſs that will not lie, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 5.</p>
            <p>Now the witneſs of Conſcience is according to the qualities of men; it excuſeth good men, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 1. and thereupon followeth Peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. It convinceth and accuſeth wicked men, <hi>John</hi> 8. 9. it condemns them alſo, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 11. 1 St. <hi>John</hi> 3. 20. aie, and it torments them, by occaſioning ſhame and anxiety of ſpirit, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 26. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21. Grief, Trembling, and Deſparation, theſe are uſually the Adjuncts and Concomitants of a perplexed Conſcience.</p>
            <p>There are three things conſiderable in Mans Conſcience.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, <hi>The Matter.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, <hi>The Act.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Thirdly, <hi>The Conſcequence.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The Matter of Mans Conſcience before the Fall, was a Conformity in the whole Man, to the whole will of God.</p>
            <p>The Act of Mans Conſcience then, was to give a true teſtimony thereof.</p>
            <p>And the Conſequence (upon Mans continuance
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51850:8"/> in that Eſtate) would have been Peace and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Such a good Conſcience would have remain'd in man if he had continued in his entire Eſtate: But by mans Fall, his good Conſcience was quite loſt, and now is become (altogether) Evil. <hi>Every imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans heart, is onely evil continually,</hi> Gen. 6. 5. And now mans evil Conſcience ſhoweth itſelf to be ſo, two ways.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>In the defect of Trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>In the exceſs of Trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In the defect of Trouble: When Sinners have upon them a Stoical Apathy, a Spirit of ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber upon them, as that they have no remorſe at all in their Hearts; they have no trouble for Sins paſt, but have a ſetled purpoſe and reſolution to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Sin. Such a Conſcience is called a ſeared Conſcience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. ſuch a Conſcience had they of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 19. that were paſt feeling, and gave themſelves over to laſciviouſneſs, to work all uncleanneſs with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Such a Conſcience had <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience had <hi>Ahab,</hi> that ſold himſelf to work wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. Such as theſe have a Brow of Braſs, they know no ſhame, <hi>Zep.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> An evil Conſcience ſhoweth itſelf to be ſo, in the exceſs of Trouble: When wicked men wanting Prayer, and Repentance, and Faith, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51850:9"/> Hope, and the Pardon of Sin, and the Inhabitation of the Spirit, and the comfort of the Scriptures (which ſhould be ſupports to them) are troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove meaſure, for that their Life is a burden to them: In the Morning they wiſh that it were Night; in the Night they wiſh it were Morning. They are like the rageing Sea, that continually caſts up Mire and Foam: this was the condition of <hi>Cain, Judas,</hi> and <hi>Spira.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Why, but you will ſay, Why ſhould wicked men be thus deſcriminated and diſtinguiſhed from others, as being reſtleſs and unquiet? Are not the beſt of men by the voice of Gods Word, Law, and Goſpel; and by the voice of Judgments, and by the Acts of Conſcience, informing, warning, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, and judicial in a perplexed Eſtate alſo? <hi>Heman</hi> complains of troubles and terrours, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. he was ſenſible of Gods fierce wrath, of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming wrath, a cutting, killing, and ſurrounding wrath, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 6, 7, 15, 16. Yet <hi>Heman</hi> was one of the wiſeſt men, next after <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 31. The condition of <hi>Job</hi> was like that of <hi>Heman;</hi> he thought that God wrote bitter things againſt him, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 24, 26. He was ſcared with Dreams, and terrified with Viſions, ſo that his Soul choſe ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and death, rather than life, <hi>Job</hi> 7. 14, 15, 20. He thought himſelf to be ſet up as a mark to ſhoot at; he was a burden to himſelf; he went mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51850:9"/> without the Sun, <hi>Job</hi> 30. 28. Yet <hi>Job</hi> was a great and good man: As for his greatneſs, he was ſuppoſed to be the King of the <hi>Edomites;</hi> and as for his goodneſs, he was one that feared God and eſchewed evil, <hi>Job</hi> 1. <hi>David</hi> complains <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. 6. <hi>I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly, I go mourning all the day long. I am feeble and ſore bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; I have roared for the (very) diſquietneſs of my heart.</hi> Yet <hi>David</hi> was a man famous in his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for Piety and Holineſs; he was a man <hi>after Gods own heart,</hi> 1 Sam. 13. 14. He is called <hi>the man of God,</hi> Nehemiah 12. 36. Amiable and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable before God and Man: So his name <hi>(David)</hi> ſignifieth.</p>
            <p>Now for Anſwer to this: We muſt note that the Troubles of <hi>Job, Heman,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> were Troubles not in the Conſcience (onely) but alſo in the Affections; and this occaſioned a Godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as being an effect of Grace. And they had the Uſe and Exerciſe of Prayer, and Faith in the midſt of their Diſtreſſes, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. 1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 9. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 5. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10. So that the Iſſue of all their Troubles was glorious. After an <hi>Eſeck,</hi> and a <hi>Sitnah,</hi> there was a <hi>Rehaboth,</hi> Gen. 26. 20, 21, 22. after the Wind, Earthquake, and Fire, there came a ſtill Voice, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 11, 12. after an Hectick, Health; after an Eclipſe, clear Light,—<hi>Sequitur</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:51850:10"/> 
               <hi>post nubula Phoebus.</hi> After Showers, Sun-ſhine; after a Wandering in the Wilderneſs, a <hi>Canaans</hi> Reſt. They had ſecret Supports in their greateſt Extremities, and (at the laſt) had an anſwer of Peace and Comfort: But the Troubles of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> were no whit the Troubles of Affections, but of Conſcience onely; and where there is a trouble of Conſcience onely, it is to be looked upon (onely) as a judicial Act of God, upon the Conſcience, and it is not to be looked upon as an Effect of Grace, but as a part of the Wages of Sin.
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>The Subject of Conſcience is the Soul.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>The Object of Conſcience is Sin.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now where the Conſcience onely is awakened and enlightened by a common illumination, (ſo as to ſee Sin) it is then in a condition to accuſe, and condemn, and vex the Sinner. That trouble in the Conſcience, which is onely a judicial Act, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in Senſe and Accuſation) God in Judgment brings upon the Tranſgreſſour. When Inſtruction, Direction, Councels, Cautions, Threatnings, and Checks do not keep men from ſinning; then God doth (after Sin) awaken the Conſcience, to accuſe for Sinning; and then the Soul is filled with bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and then the terrours of Hell do ſhake and confound the Soul. Men ſo tormented, long after Death, and if it come not, they ſearch after it more than treaſures, and rejoyce when they can find the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51850:10"/> Grave. Conſcience works upon Sin, and Sin frets and vexeth the Soul; ſo that Conſcience becomes as a Worm that never dieth, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66. 24. Heavineſs in the heart of man maketh it ſtoop, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 15. By the ſorrow of the heart the Spirit is broken, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 13. Such an one is as one bruiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Wall and the Door. <hi>Nulla gravior poena poenâ conſcientiae,</hi> ſaid <hi>Iſiodorus:</hi> There is no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more grievous than the puniſhment of a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Conſcience. The Rack and Wheel are, and—<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ri, virgis, ferroque, necari.</hi> Burning and Scourging, and all thoſe bloudy cruelties invented by the Heathen Perſecutors, are ſhort of this: <hi>A wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> Prov. 18. 14. <hi>Juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> deſcribes the ſad eſtate of ſuch men thus:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>—<hi>Cur tamen hos tu</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Evaſiſſe putes, quos diri conſcia facti</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Mens habet attonitos, &amp; ſurdo verbere caedit,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Occulto quatiente animo tortore flagellum?</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>They that are guilty of foul Facts, are affrighted in their Conſcience; they are ſcourged and beaten with unknown blows. Their Conſcience (like an Executioner) whips, bites, and torments them: an evil Conſcience ſits as a Judge, and it is call'd in as a Witneſs; nay more, an evil Conſcience is, <hi>Judex, Testis, Carcer, Tortor, Judicat, Accuſat, Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat.</hi> An evil Conſcience is a Judge, a Witneſs, a Priſon, an Executioner; it keeps Seſſions within it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51850:11"/> ſelf; it accuſeth, judgeth, and condemneth. An evil Conſcience is a plague which you can neither <hi>fugere,</hi> nor <hi>fugare;</hi> it is an Evil which a Sinner can neither flee, nor fly from.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cain</hi> put himſelf upon the building of a City, to remove the troubles of his mind; but that would not do it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> thought by his Cups, to remove the trouble of his Spirit; but that would not remove it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 2. Such men in the midſt of their greateſt delights, Singing, Dancing, and Dalliance, are tortured in their Souls. As <hi>Lemnius</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Nocte dieque ſuum geſtant in pectore teſtem:</hi> Night and day they carry their Witneſs and Accuſer within their breaſts. So that outward pleaſures and delights cannot more cure their Wounded Conſcience, than a Crown of Gold can cure the Head-ach, or a Velvet Slipper cure the Gout. A perplexed man in the midſt of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pleaſures, riches, and honours, is like a Book of Tragedies, fairly bound up without, but black within; the Leaves Gold, and the Lines Blood: no Friends nor Phyſick, no Gold nor Silver, nor Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Princes, no Pleaſures of the World can give comfort in ſuch a caſe; neither Crowns nor King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms can give deliverance in ſuch a caſe. There is no Bodily Sickneſs but Nature (by the means of Phyſick) hath provided a Remedy; no Sore but Chirurgery hath provided a Salve for it. There is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51850:11"/> no outward miſery but there may be ſome means to relieve it; Friendſhip helps Poverty, Hope of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty eaſeth Impriſonment, Favour revokes Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Time wears away Reproach; but none of all theſe things can relieve or comfort a diſtreſſed Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pierius</hi> makes a continually hot baking Oven the Hierogliphick of a gauled Conſcience. And the <hi>Egyptians</hi> made a Mill an Hierogliphick of the ſame; both for continuance and torture. A man ſo perplexed is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a ſelf-Tormentor: ſuch an ones Conſcience (like <hi>Titius</hi> his <hi>Vulture)</hi> doth continually knaw him. That which was feigned of <hi>Promethaeus</hi> (as being bound to a Pillar upon the Mountain <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> and an Eagle eating his Liver every day, and that which was eaten in the day, grew up in the night, (that there might be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of his torment) is true in this caſe; it is a Worm that never dieth. Such an ones Houſe may be compared to <hi>Trophonius</hi> his Den, where were nothing but doleful Ecchoes and ſad Complaints. A perplexed wicked man may take to him <hi>Paſhurs</hi> terrible Name mentioned in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 20. 3. <hi>Magor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſabib,</hi> that is, fear round about: ſuch an one is a terrour to himſelf, and to all that are about him. What ſhall I ſay more? A troubled Conſcience is an Epitomy of Hell, an Extract, a Quinteſence, a Compound, a Mixture of all Malladies, Tyrannical
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51850:12"/> Tortures, Plagues, and Perplexities; Fear, Sorrow, Fury, Grief, Pain, Terrour, Anger, all theſe things come ſhort of it. Were I to write a full Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Troubled Conſcience, (though I had <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomene</hi> for my Muſe, and had a Pen of Iron drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cruelty, and had Ink, and writing as Bloud) yet I could not ſufficiently delineate it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this caſe I ſhall do like <hi>Timanthes,</hi> who when he was to draw out the Picture of <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> Grief, (and was not able to perfect it) co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it over with a Veil; he Pictur'd <hi>Calchas</hi> ſad, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> mourning, and <hi>Menelaus</hi> more ſorrowful than either of them; but as for <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> (whoſe Daughter <hi>Iphiginia</hi> was to be ſacrificed) he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his grief and ſorrow to be <hi>in ſummo gradu,</hi> not to be deciphered by Art; and therefore he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his Face with a Veil, and left every man to his own conceit about it. So in this caſe, being not able throughly to deſcribe the miſery of an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Conſcience; I ſhall break off abruptly, as to the farther Explication of this point, and ſhall leave every man to his own imagination about it. I have done with the Tragical part.</p>
            <p>And now I am apt to think that ſome drooping Spirits (groaning under the preſſure of Sin, and ready to deſpond and deſpair, by reaſon of ſome preſent guilt upon them, for ſome foul facts commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) are ready to ſay to me, Muſt we part thus?
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51850:12"/> Are there no crumbs of comfort? Shall we hear no word of peace? Will you let your voice be (ſtill) like the hoarſe ſound of a Trumpet in a dead march? Shall your Sermon be like <hi>Dracoes</hi> Laws, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and ended in death? Is there <hi>no balme in Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead?</hi> Is there no Phyſician there? Is there no way to be reconciled to God, and to have a peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our ſelves, and to have our Wounded Spirits healed? Why, yes I ſhall (by and by) come to the Conſolatory part, and ſhall put you into a way to be at peace with God, and to have peace within your ſelves, and to have your Spirits calm'd, and your Conſciences quieted. But before I come to lay down any Rules of direction or means to obtain this; I ſhall lay down Motives to perſwade you hereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> God hath promiſed it, <hi>The Lord will ſpeak peace to his people,</hi> Pſal. 85. 8. <hi>Peace ſhall be upon Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 125. <hi>I create the fruit of the lips: peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is nigh,</hi> Iſai. 57. 19. that is, <q>I will really accompliſh that which I have promiſed (in giving peace) both to Jews and Gentiles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Chriſt hath purchaſed our Peace; The chaſtiſement of our Peace was upon him; there was a proclamation of Peace at Chriſt's coming into the World; the great Deſign of Chriſt was to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile God to man, and to pacifie mans Conſcience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:51850:13"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Others have obtained Peace within themſelves: <hi>David,</hi> who for three quarters of a year was in a <hi>Spiritual Lethargie,</hi> (being at length awakened, was much perplexed) yet was at length reſtored to the joy of Salvation. Mr. <hi>Bilney</hi> (for a whole Year) was in ſuch anguiſh of Spirit, that he thought all the whole Scriptures were againſt him, and founded out his condemnation; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he was indued with ſuch Strength and Faith, that he did not onely confeſs his Faith in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, but ſuffered his Body to be burnt for the Goſpels ſake. <hi>Luther</hi> about the year 1514, was in ſuch an Agony of Spirit, that he felt nothing but trembling and fearfulneſs, eſpecially when (at <hi>Rome)</hi> upon his bare Knees he was climbing up cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Steps of <hi>Pilate</hi>'s <hi>Ladder,</hi> (which the <hi>Romanist</hi> feigned to be brought from <hi>Jeruſalem)</hi> when he was doing this (in a Superſtitious way) as a means to purge his Sins, and quiet his reſtleſs and troubled Minde, by the illumination of the Spirit he came to a right underſtanding of that Scripture, <hi>The just ſhall live by</hi> his <hi>faith;</hi> and then he was exceedingly comforted, and his mind was pacified, and he ſet about the Reformation, and became a wonderful Inſtrument of God (through whom God hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the light of his Word) to the World. Such examples as theſe (who have found peace with God and within themſelves) ſhould encourage us.</p>

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Conſider the Miſery of a Troubled Conſcience, <hi>A wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> And a wounded ſpirit who can declare? As the troubles of the Soul are inſupportable, ſo they are inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. A wicked mans Conſcience is the greateſt Tyrant and Perſecutour to himſelf; he needs no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fury to follow him; this is both Accuſer and Witneſs, Law and Judge, Executioner and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to himſelf. A Soul left to the temptations of the Devil, and to its own darkneſs and unbelief; like <hi>Saul</hi> falls upon its own Sword, and becomes its own Executioner: <hi>The wicked fleeth when none pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth:</hi> The wicked (in this reſpect) are like Sheep, of which it is ſaid, that when they run, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the ſound of their own Feet: Sin doth beget a dejection of Spirit and fearful Terrours. After <hi>Herod</hi> had murdered <hi>John</hi> in the Priſon, he was perplext, his mind was much about <hi>John;</hi> for when he heard of the great Miracles that were wrought by Chriſt, he cryed out, That it was <hi>John Baptist,</hi> riſen from the dead, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 1. Upon the commiſſion of Sin there follows a Spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage unto Fear; ſo that ſinners are in a condition as if they were fettered and ſhut up in Priſon. They are full of anguiſh, vexation, and terrour: they are afraid to come near God, and afraid that God will never come near them in Mercy; they are afraid to die, and afraid of Gods wrath, revealed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51850:14"/> from Heaven againſt their Sins; they are afraid of what they have done againſt God, and afraid of what God may do againſt them. <hi>Nicephorus Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour, and <hi>Pauſanius</hi> the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> King, (having done foul facts) were tired with a continual vexation of Spirit, always afraid of Heavens vengeance. Theſe troubles of perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souls are not Fabulous things, and we have the Word of God for it: <hi>There is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God;</hi> in the Text. And theſe words are ſeveral times repeated in this Propheſie: And <hi>Verba toties inculcata, vera ſunt, viva ſunt, plana ſunt, ſana ſunt.</hi> Words often repeated are true, and lively, ſound, and plain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Conſider the happy eſtate of thoſe who are at peace with God, and at peace within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> They are related to God, as to a Father; they are related to a Wiſe, Powerful, and Merciful God; they are aſſured of Gods care over them, and of his providence and goodneſs toward them; they have the light of Gods Countenance ſhining upon them; they are ſenſible of Gods favour, and of his loving kindneſs, which is better than Life itſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They have an intereſt in Chriſt, who is the Brightneſs of his Fathers Glory; they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into Chriſt, and incorporated into that My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body, whereof Chriſt is the Head; they have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51850:14"/> an intereſt in the Merits of Chriſt, and in all the Fruits and Effects of his Death and Bloodſhed; and in him they have a Spiritual Title to all the things of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They have a right to all the rich pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in Scripture, both of Grace and Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They ſee all their Sins charged upon Chriſt, laid upon his Shoulders, and pardoned as to themſelves: they ſee all their Sins ſo remitted as that they are not afrighted, neither by the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude nor multitude of their Sins; beſides all this, they are not afraid of the Faces of men, though rich, honourable, and powerful; they fear not the Sons of <hi>Anak,</hi> nor the <hi>Gammodims</hi> in the Towers; they are not afraid of reproaches nor loſſes, either of Goods, Friends, or Children; they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of want, either of Food or Raiment, though there ſhould be no Flocks nor Herds in the Fields or Stalls, yet they can rejoyce in the God of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; they are not afraid of Baniſhment into a Wilderneſs, or into a ſtrange Land; they are not afraid of Impriſonment; they can look upon a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as a Pallace, and upon a Chain as an Ornament, and upon Bondage itſelf as Liberty; they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of Wars, nor of Famine, nor of Sickneſs, nor Death itſelf: the excellency of this Peace is ſuch, and the benefits and comforts of it are ſo many and great, as they cannot be throughly known; <hi>The peace of God paſſeth all underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:51850:15"/>
            <p>Now you will ſay, We are convinced that it is our Duty to ſeek after a Peace of Conſcience within our ſelves, But how ſhall we obtain it? The means are there,</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, <hi>Reſist the Devil.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, <hi>Keep at a diſtance from Sin.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Thirdly, <hi>Set about Repentance.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Fourthly, <hi>Hearken diligently to the Goſpel.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. Reſiſt the Devil, Whoſe work it is to tempt to Sin, and then to accuſe for Sin, and then to tempt to Deſparation. When Chriſt reſiſted the Devil <hi>he departed for a ſeaſon,</hi> Luke 4. 14. And do you <hi>reſist the devil, and he will flee from you,</hi> James 4. 7.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Keep at a diſtance from Sin: <hi>Pliny</hi> 10. <hi>Lib.</hi> 67. <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> writes thus of the Chriſtians of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times: <hi>Stato die ante lucem convenire, &amp; ſe Sacramento obſtringere, nè furta, nè latrocinia, ne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteria committerent:</hi> By break of the day they met together, and bound themſelves by an Oath, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sins of Adultery, Theft, and Rapine. Let your reſolution be the ſame againſt all Sin, as being that that hath made a variance between God and you, and a diſturbance in your Souls. <hi>If ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity be in thine hand, put it far away; then thou ſhalt be ſtedfast, and ſhalt not fear,</hi> Job 11. 14, 15.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Set about Repentance: <hi>They who ſow in tears ſhall reap in joy.</hi> Broken hearts ſhall be bound up: The ſpirits of the contrite ſhall be revived:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51850:15"/> The weary and heavy laden ſhall reſt: There is a promiſe of comfort, to penitential mourners, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 4. That woman who was a notorious Sinner (when ſhe ſtood at Chriſts feet, weeping and waſhing his feet with tears) was forgiven and comforted. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort doth not follow Repentance as a Natural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: Repentance doth not diſcharge us from the guilt of Sin, as an Act of ours; but as it is a work of Grace, and as a means appointed (by God) for that end.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Hearken diligently to the Goſpel: The Goſpel is called Glad Tidings; <hi>It is a goſpel of peace,</hi> Rom. 10. 15. <hi>A word of Reconciliation,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. Miniſters of the Goſpel are like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, which brought him an Olive branch, a Token of Peace: Miniſters are Ambaſſadours for Chriſt. It is a term borrowed by the Apoſtle from Princes Courts, and applyed to Miniſters by a decent Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie; Miniſters being as Ambaſſadours, who are Meſſengers from Princes Courts to offer Peace.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures (which are the Subject, and the Subſtance of Miniſters Preaching) are the Word of God, who is a God of all Conſolation; and being fitly applyed are likely to revive and refreſh faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fearful Spirits. Here you will finde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of comfort, and examples of thoſe who have found comfort. Here you will find God merciful and gracious, forgiving Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51850:16"/> Sin. Here you will find that Gods Mercies hold proportion with his Power; and that they are not to be limited by the bounds of your weak under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings: And know, that as it is Blaſphemy to limit Gods Power, ſo it is Blaſphemy to limit his Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures will tell you, that God is a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mercies, a God that revives the Spirits of the humble, and the Heart of the contrite ones; that he is nigh to them who are of a broken Heart, and ſaveth ſuch as be of a contrite Spirit. And therefore hearken dilligently to the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, as being a Word of Peace, and a Word of Comfort. And know this, That it is your duty to receive comfort, (when it is offered upon good grounds) as to do a duty commanded It is a great Sin to reject or deſpair of Mercy: it is thought by ſome to be a greater Sin in <hi>Judas</hi> to deſpair of Mercy, than it was to betray the Perſon of Chriſt into the hands of them who crucified him. Oh, therefore let not your ſtubborn Souls refuſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort! But when Gods Mercy appears to you in his Word Preached, yield to the credit of it, and be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver power'd with the Authority of it; let your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences be ſatisfied with thoſe evidences that God hath made known in his Word, and paſſed upon your Souls for your everlaſting comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Give your ſelves unto Prayer. <hi>Oratio,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:51850:16"/> 
               <hi>ſanat peſtes mentis:</hi> Prayer is a means to cure the Malladies of Diſeaſed Souls: Prayer is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs by which we ſail. When all is clouded, no Star of comfort ſhining upon us, this will hold us in the right Courſe, till we again diſcover Mercy. <hi>Out of the depth have I called unto thee, and thou heardst me,</hi> Pſal. 130. 1. Prayer is a means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the pardon of Sin, <hi>James</hi> 5. 14. And upon the pardon of Sin follows peace and comfort, <hi>Be of good cheer, thy ſins are forgiven thee,</hi> Mat. 9. 2. Let the conſideration of Gods All-ſufficiency, his Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his Grace and Mercy, his Readineſs to Pardon and Comfort; his rich Promiſes move you to pray in Faith, in Humility, and with Fervency, that he would quiet your Spirits and ſtabliſh your Hearts. And in your Prayer to the Lord Chriſt, plead his humanity, that He Himſelf did once live in your Nature on Earth, as in a Veil of Tears, and Miſery, and in the ſhadow of Death; that He Himſelf was once cloathed on Earth with the Infirmities of mans common Nature; that He Himſelf knows what it is to be tempted by Satan, by Men, both Friends and Enemies; that He knows what it is to be in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony, to lie under a Spiritual Deſertion, to have a Soul exceeding ſorrowful and heavy (even) unto Death. Entreat Him (as being a Merciful High Prieſt, and as being touched with the feeling of your Infirmities) to have compaſſion upon you, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51850:17"/> and ſuccour you: remember Him who cry'd out, <hi>Thou Son of David have mercy on me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Labour after Righteouſneſs in your dealings with men; that is a way to obtain peace: <hi>Say unto the righteous it ſhall go well with him.</hi> A due Adminiſtration of Juſtice by Magiſtrates, and Righteous dealing between man and man, is a means to uphold <hi>Legem, Regem,</hi> and <hi>Gregem:</hi> The Law, the King, and Country. And it is a means to procure peace to your ſelves: <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the end of that man is peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Set about the exerciſe of Charity. It was <hi>David</hi>'s enquiry, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 1. <hi>Is there any of the houſe of Saul left, to whom I may ſhew kindneſs for Jonathan's ſake?</hi> And let it be your enquiry, Are there no poor members of Chriſt, to whom we may ſhew kindneſs for Chriſt's ſake? True Religion lieth much in this. And therefore be not weary of well doing: <hi>Do good to all men, but eſpecially to the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhould of faith.</hi> This is a means to bring peace to you at the laſt: <hi>The merciful ſhall enter into peace, and ſhall rest in their beds,</hi> Iſai 59. 1. If in your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards the poor members of Chriſt, you have reſpect to the glory of God, and the honour of Chriſt, and ſhall reſt upon his Approbation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneration; you ſhall find (at laſt) that Chriſt will own it, as being done to himſelf; and will ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51850:17"/> and reward it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. But chiefly we muſt make ſure of Chriſt when we have done all, or elſe we may miſs of peace and comfort: We muſt have comfortable apprehenſions of the fulneſs of Chriſt's Merits, or elſe we can have no peace with God, nor within our ſelves.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Luther</hi>'s Obſervation: Saith he, <hi>I have ſeen among the Papists, who have painfully travelled, and upon meer Conſcience have done much in Praying and Faſting, and other Exerciſes for this End, that they might get peace of Conſcience; and when they had done all, they were ſmitten down with fear, eſpecially when death approached: They were then,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that I have ſeen many Murderers, and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors condemn'd to death, die more couragiouſly, and more comfortably than they.</hi> This was <hi>Luther</hi>'s Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in his time, and there is reaſon for it; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though good works are evidences of Faith, and ſigns of a ſanctified Life; yet they can give no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Gods favour by their own merit or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs. It is impoſſible that the Conſcience ſhould be pacified (as to God and itſelf) by any good things found in man: No, not by Faith itſelf, (for the goodneſs or merit of it, as being done by us) but as being a grace given us to apprehend the fulneſs of merit onely in Chriſt. And therefore when you have done all, make ſure of Chriſt by Faith.</p>
            <p>In the Creation we find God above us; In the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51850:18"/> Law we find God againſt us: But in Chriſt we find God <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> God with us: <hi>O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock,</hi> Cant. 2. 14. This was the Speech of Chriſt to the Church, by the mouth of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi> The Church was a Dove in the clefts of the Rock: This Rock was Chriſt, the Rock of Ages, and thoſe <hi>foramina Petrae,</hi> were <hi>vulnera Chriſti:</hi> Theſe clefts of the Rock, are the wounds of Chriſt. The Church in the wounds of Chriſt, is as a Dove in the clefts of the Rock, quiet and ſafe from danger. The Lord Chriſt was ſent to bind up the broken hearted; and to proclaime liberty to the captives; and the opening of the Priſon doors to them who were bound; to give them beauty for aſhes; the oil of joy for mourning; and the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61. 1, 3. <hi>He is that good ſheperd that gathers his lambs, and carries them in his boſome,</hi> Iſai. 40. 11. The Lord Chriſt is that Sun of Righteouſneſs, that ariſeth with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in his Wings: He is that Tree in the Revala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Leaves whereof, were for the healing of the Nations: He is the great Phyſician of Souls: He cures us of the guilt of Sin by Juſtification, of the pollution of Sin, by Sanctification; of the trouble of Conſcience, by Conſolation: He is full of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ointment, his Name (Chriſt) ſignifies ſo much: He hath Oil and Wine to pour into your wounds, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 34. He hath the Oil of Gladneſs,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51850:18"/> and the Oil of Love; But his Soveraign Medicines are his own Fleſh and Blood; <hi>By his ſtripes we are healed,</hi> Iſai. 53. <hi>He hath ſlain the enmity, and hath reconciled us by the Croſs,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 16. <hi>We are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God by the death of his Son,</hi> Rom. 5. 9, 10. <hi>The blood of Christ ſpeaks better things than the blood of Abel,</hi> Heb. 12. 24. <hi>The blood of Abel cryeth for vengeance,</hi> Gen. 4. 10. Mat. 23. 35. But the Lord Chriſt cryeth with a loud voice, (as with the voice of a mighty Angel) my Blood for the undeſerving; my Blood for the ill-deſerving; my Blood for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for the worſt of ſinners, for the chiefeſt of ſinners; my Blood for all blood; my Blood for the Sins of the World; nay, and for a World of Sins. Well might the Apoſtle call this Blood pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. It is precious Blood in itſelf, as being the Blood of the Son of God; it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in its Effects. Whereas other blood calls for Revenge, this Blood calls for Grace, for Mercy, for Pardon, for Reconciliation, for Acceptation, and Salvation: <hi>We are juſtified by his blood,</hi> Rom. 5. 9. and upon this follows our peace with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>We are waſhed alſo, and made white by this blood,</hi> Revel. 7. 14. Now the ſence and experience of the purity of heart, and a reformed life, layeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us a ground of peace and comfort: Being waſhed and ſanctified by this Blood, we have a good, a pure, and a clear Conſcience; in the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51850:19"/> whereof we may rejoyce and take comfort, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
            <p>We read of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> that when he went to to make Peace with a Prince, he carried the Princes Son in his Arms. And if you will make Peace with God (who is the King of Kings) you muſt carry Chriſt a long with you, who is the Son of God, and the Prince of Peace. If you can with old <hi>Simeon</hi> get Chriſt in your arms, you may ſing a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiem</hi> as he did. When you are thus at Peace with God, and within your ſelves; I would adviſe you to two things.</p>

The fire was kept burning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon the Altar, to ſhew us our conſtant Duty in this reſpect. God requires thankfulneſs for the leaſt Mercy: <hi>Gather up the fragments, that nothing be lost,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6. 12. We muſt be thankful for the leaſt Bleſſing; much more ſhould we be thankful for ſo great a Mercy as this. Hath the Lord Chriſt ſpoken comfortably to you in a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Hath the Lord Chriſt been to you as the Shadow of a Rock to a Traveller in a weary Land? Are you brought out of a Dungeon into a Pallace,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51850:19"/> out of Darkneſs into Light, out of the Shadow of Death into the Land of the Living? O then, ſet up <hi>David</hi>'s Reſolution!

Oh, how great is thy goodneſs! How amiable are thy tabernacles! How great are thy works! I will triumph in the work of thy hands,</hi> Pſal. 90. 4.</p>
            <p>Are you now delivered from the trouble and miſery of a Wounded Conſcience? Is that confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on formerly in your Souls now rectified? Are you now under the aſſurances of Faith? Is God in your Hearts? Is Heaven in your Eyes? Is joy in your countenances?

O let not your carriage be ſuch toward Chriſt, after a reception of Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from him! When you are got into Wiſdoms ways, (which are ways of pleaſantneſs) take heed that you do not (then) ſtart a ſide lake a broken Bow.

Grieve not the Spirit of Chriſt, which is the Cauſe of all Grace and Comfort: Reſiſt not the gracious motions of the Spirit of Chriſt, by carnal delights, or by ſinful practiſes: Let his Spirit have a full work: Let it be ſeen that the Spirit of Chriſt reigns in you, in that you will do nothing contrary to it. <hi>Spiritus Chriſti ita nos tractat, ſicut à nobis tractatur:</hi> The Spirit of Chriſt will handle you as you handle it. If you again grieve the Spirit of Chriſt, (by reſiſting the Holy motions of it) He may again vex your Spirits, in with-holding the comfortable influences of it. And therefore have an high eſteem of Chriſt, delight in him, and pleaſe him, by your obedience in the courſe of your life. By this means you may be like Saint <hi>Anthony</hi> the Monk, of whom it is ſaid, that he always appeared of a cheerful countenance. By this means you may be at peace with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, at agreement with the ſtone of the wall, and beaſts of the Fields; ſo that you may ſafely walk by the <hi>Lion,</hi> and tread upon the <hi>Baſilisk:</hi> Hereby you may find inward Peace in your Hearts and
